* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker

Activity 1:

1.
  a. sentimentVal (String word)
  b. yes, it requires a String parameter - if you pass different type of parameter, there is an error message, because other methods used require String as well
  c. yes, the return type is double

2.
  sentimentVal("orange") => 0.32
  sentimentVal("cat") => -1.86
  sentimentVal("outlandish") => 0.0
3.
  a. it would compile because the output is a double, and the input is a String
  b. it would not compile because the output is a String and the input is a double - it should be double and String
  c. it would not compile because there are two inputs, whereas sentimentVal requires one String input

Activity 2:

4.
  totalSentiment looks through the file, and searches for spaces. Once it finds a space through iteration, it will register the previous letters as a word, and will find the sentimentVal for that word. It will then remove that word from the inputted String, and continue iterating through, summing up the sentimentVals in the process. Once there is nothing left in the String input, the totalSentiment is returned.
