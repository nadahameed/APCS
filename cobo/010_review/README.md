errata:

* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker

## APCS PD07
## L06 - Read/Review/Expand - consumer review cobo lab
## 2022-02-14
## time spent: 2.5 hours

#### note: couldn't include tnpg in txt files :)

## bumps in the road:
- figuring out how to fill negative and positiveAdjectives
  -> eventually we just created our own instead of trying to take them from cleanSentiment
- spent a bit of time on totalSentiment and fakeReview -> those were a bit confusing to grasp
- what to do for activity 5?

## timeline:
  #### day 1:
    - activity 1 and starRating in activity 2
  #### day 2:
    - finished activity 2, started negative and positive adjectives in activity 3/4
  #### weekend:
    - finished activities 3 and 4
    - brainstormed and finished activity 5

## questions:
- what are hashmaps?
- is there a way to sort the adjectives in cleanSentiment into negative/positive (that we can do with what we know so far)?
