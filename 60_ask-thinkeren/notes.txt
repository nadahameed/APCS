DISCO:
- the process gets messy as more people try and intervene (hence the rule that only thinkeren with cards can speak)
- there are several ways to merge two sorted lists
- our classmates struggled with how to deal with suits
-> we came to the consensus that numbers have greater priority than suits

QCC:
- it may take a while for our class to achieve total silence while sorting
- what's the best way to merge two sorted (or unsorted) lists (not specific to cards in the hands of 16-17yr olds)?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
- only thinkers with cards can speak
- they can only speak to less than three other thinkeren
- thinker with cards splits deck into two unless they have less than two cards or the cards are unsorted
- they pass cards to two other thinkeren and hold out their hands, signifying that they are waiting for two sorted decks to be handed back to them
- if one has less than two cards, they have a sorted card!
- if the cards in a thinker's hand are sorted, they pass them back to the thinker who handed it to them
- only pass back cards if they are sorted
- return cards to Mr. Mykolyk
