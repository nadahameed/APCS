   DISCO:
   We understood how we can know that Java provides a constructor for us, because when we create a new instance of an object, it does something, even when the method used isn't defined.
   System.out.print will output a string representation of an object.
   
   QCC:
   For the PIN, we tried to do it with a short, but the compiler kept thinking it was a integer, so it changed it to a short.
   
   Q2 Response:
   When we create a new instance of a class, we say new ClassName(), and since ClassName() has parentheses, it is a method.
   We didn't define this method the code but Java includes it for us, which is why we can use it.
   
   Q3 Response:
   We can override the toString method by rewriting the toString method, and it will output a string representation of an object.
