 * class GuessNumber -- fun fun fun!
 *
 * SKELETON
 *
 * eg, sample interaction with end user:
 *
 * Guess a # fr 1-100: 50
 * Too high
 * Guess a # fr 1-49: 25
 * Too low
 * Guess a # fr 26-49: 38
 * Correct! It took 3 guesses
 ***/

/***
    DISCO:
    - guess = sc.nextLine() will take what the user types in and set it to guess
      -> if you type something that isn't an int, you will get an Exception error
    QCC:
    - when setting _target, we didn't use _lo or _hi in the name of caution
    - under the guise of grammar, it'd make sense to be able to adapt to guessing in one try (v "tries")
    - we could also adapt to a guess that's higher than the given range
